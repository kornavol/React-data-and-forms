## Description

 Training project when we are working with requests  (fetch, axios, kyc)  (Post and Get) and managing forms.
 We are using "get" request to get  dataset from API and Post for authorization (sign up, sign in)

## To-DO

## Questions

- Why useEffect don't fire if variable value is changing?
- Why background of Auth. had been changed after when I putted it into 'useState'?
